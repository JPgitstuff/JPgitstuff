üëã **Hey there! I‚Äôm Jan-Paul**

I'm currently in my third year at Belgium Campus ITversity, exploring the intersection of Software Engineering, IoT, Machine Learning, and real-world problem solving. I'm passionate about building impactful projects and strive to make everything I create as efficient and effective as possible. As I progress in my studies, I continuously work to expand my knowledge of programming languages, frameworks, and tools. I always put in my best effort and aim to exceed expectations in everything I do.

my work always ties back to one goal:

  ‚öôÔ∏è Make things that work.
      Not just code that runs, but tools that solve real problems and make users life easier I try to build with impact, clarity and efficiently in mind.

üß† **How I Think**:

I love digging deep into systems design, where data, user needs, and code all connect. Whether it‚Äôs optimizing a database query or tuning hyperparameters, I bring a blend of precision, practicality, and enough energy to keep it fun and entertaining for myself and potential users.



üß≠ **Currently Exploring:**:

- React and other frontend frameworks
- RESTful APIs & full-stack architectures
- Selene: A web-based GPS navigation client built with TypeScript, React, and Vite
- Pylon: A Python-based sensor processor for real-time weather data with RabbitMQ integration
- Raspberry Pi: IoT development for embedded systems and mobile weather stations
- ‚öô Tools like Docker, RabbitMQ, and real-time messaging pipelines
