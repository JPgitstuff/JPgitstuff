üëã Hey there! I‚Äôm Jan-Paul
Currently in my third year at Belgium Campus ITversity, I‚Äôm exploring the intersection of software engineering.


my work always ties back to one goal:

  ‚öôÔ∏è Make things that work.
      Not just code that runs, but tools that solve real problems and make users life easier I try to build with impact, clarity and efficiently in mind.


üí° **Tech & Tools I Use:**

Languages: Java | C# | Python | JavaScript | HTML/CSS
Frameworks: Node.js | .NET | JSP/Servlets | Express | Dash
Databases: PostgreSQL | MySQL | MongoDB
Other: Bootstrap 5 | EJS | Git | VS Code | Arduino | Raspberry Pi

üß† **How I Think**:

I love digging deep into systems design, where data, user needs, and code all connect. Whether it‚Äôs optimizing a database query or tuning hyperparameters, I bring a blend of precision, practicality, and enough energy to keep it fun and entertaining for myself and potential users.
